## Usage
Each design pattern is implemented in its separate directory. To complile the code, use command:

```
And the executables will be in the folder `./build/{Design pattern name}/`.

## Readings
The code examples and illustration presented by this repository are highly inspired by two books:

- Iglberger, Klaus. (2022). _C++ Software Design_.  O'Reilly Media.

- Freeman, E., Robson, E., Bates, B., & Sierra, K. (2004). _Head First Design Patterns_. O'Reilly Media.

These books aren't just recommended reading; they're essential guides for those eager to deepen their understanding and mastery of design patterns and advanced C++ software design. Embark on this enlightening journey to transform your coding skills!
