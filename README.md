# Command Pattern

## Introduction
> The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects with different requests, queue or log requests, and
support undoable operations.  
-- _Head First Design Patterns_

## Scenario
- A customer wants to build a smart home by controlling EVERYTHING with just a control center. 

- The customer orders a control center with 6 customized options. Each option can be set to be simple operations like "turning on TV" or complex operations such as "making room comfortable".

- The customer purchases a TV, a light and an air conditioner. They all provide different controlling methods.

- Purchasing TV, light and air conditioner is just a start. More furnitures are on their way home.
